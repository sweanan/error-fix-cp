git clone <above repo>
open in devcontainer
az login
az account set --subscription <subscriptionname>

In order to view the pods the repo contains a fetch-kubeconfig.sh script when run fetches the kubeconfig file. Once the kubeconfig is retrived the pods can be viewed by `kubectl get pods -A`or by using the kubernetes extension in vscode as below

In order to attach the storage account that is required for the netobs solution, the storage account can be added to this resource group by using the same terraform repo and adding the code to support it or it can be added from the Azure Portal associating to the same resource group name of RKE2 cluster.

Below is a example of adding the storage account resource to the terraform script.

```bash
data "azurerm_resource_group" "rg" {
  name = "rke2-efr-crewathena"
}

resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
  name                     = "azureteststorage"
  resource_group_name      = data.azurerm_resource_group.rg.name
  location                 = data.azurerm_resource_group.rg.location
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS"
}

resource "azurerm_storage_share" "example" {
  name                 = "sharename"
  storage_account_name = azurerm_storage_account.example.name
  quota                = 50
}

resource "azurerm_storage_share_file" "example" {
  name             = "test.zip"
  storage_share_id = azurerm_storage_share.example.id
  source           = "test.zip"
}
```
